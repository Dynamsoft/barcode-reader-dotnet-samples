## License

The library requires a license to work, you use the API InitLicenseFromDLS to tell the program where to fetch your license.

If the Organizaion ID is not specified or set as "200001", a 7-day (public) trial license will be used by default which is the case in these samples.

Note that network connection is required for this license to work.

When using your own license, locate the following line and specify your Organization ID.  
// organizationID = "200001";

If you don't have a license yet, you can request a trial from <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dbr&utm_source=samples&package=dotnet" target="_blank">Customer Portal</a>
